Thank you for your dedication to learning & making education a fun & wonderful experience.

If they are struggling with the school setting either academically or socially this is a great choice. Early pandemic we discovered the local school system very much struggling with online academics. So was my daughter. We tried another program specific to WA state but it was a boring flop for us too. Shauna created a program designed to interest my teen daughter and keep her learning. The program is a breath of fresh air and works very well with our busy equine sports activities and schedule. We have not missed out on the nasty social aspects of teen education using 4h and High School Equestrian team for a controlled social environment.',\n",

       "       'review': 'Pacific Sands Academy is a lighthouse of hope and inspiration in a sea of educational factories. Our brilliant son endured a year and a half of public high school being bored out of his mind with all of the conformity and ever increasing standardized testing. This killed his passion for learning and he began believing the lies that he was not smart since he didn’t fit into this conventional model of education. His self-esteem and grades took a nose dive.Thank God we found Ms. Shauna who puts the passion back into learning. Not only a teacher, I like to think of her as a mentor/coach assisting students on their self-directed educational pathway. She really has a gift to encourage and nurture student’s gifts and passions giving them a sense of validation and boosting their self-esteem. Ms. Shauna has many unconventional tools in her teaching tool box that use creative ways to get those hated subjects completed as well as very inventive ways to get credits including (for our son):Economics and Investment Strategies (investing in crypto and stocks)Practical Math:Construction Trades (doing home remodeling)STEM:Mechanical Engineering (training/working at a motorcycle repair shop)After graduating from Pacific Sands Academy, our brilliant son loves to learn again. Most importantly, he believes in himself and has hope for his future.',\n",

       "       'review': 'Pacific Sands was a huge blessing in our lives. My son was in 9th grade and had totally lost interest in learning and eventually pursuing a career so we decided to give this program a try and he did 10th grade with Shawna. The way she personalized and facilitated the learning experience for him was amazing! He started realizing he was now in charge of his education. He could make decisions and design his path, felt respected, understood, reassured in his individuality, assisted in finding his way and empowered to the point he felt he wanted to try going back to public school to have more of the social experience. He did that for 11th grade and when the pandemic came and all learning was online he went back to Pacific Sands and graduated at a super fast pace. He’s now in college pursuing Automotive Technology and most importantly he is excited about it. I can’t thank Shawna and her program enough for offering this wonderful alternative to traditional education. Not every child fits that mold but they all have a huge potential and this program gives them the opportunity to discover it.',\n",

Moving back to the Scotts Valley area was a great relief, and while we were living in Round Rock, Texas for a couple of year we found what an excellent school can offer. Returning in 2010 we've been more than pleased with what Brook Knoll offers our third son who is now in the fifth grade. All of his teachers (2nd - present) have been incredible, putting in long hours, making sure our son is challenged and that he learns to his highest potential. The teachers we've had are creative and vibrant as are all of the aids and volunteers. The parent involvement at this school is greater than any local school we've looked into, and it is not because they have to, it is because they want to. Go Eagles! BK Rocks!\",\n",

They need some new, young, progressive thinking teachers with fresh ideas. The children are suffering from lack of new teaching styles (we\\'ve witnessed TONS of worksheets from K-2nd - the very age these kids should be learning outside or through creative ways), learning or extra support. This school used to be \\'the great little place to be\\' when I was growing up and went here. Class size is 30-34 kids. Parent involvement is good, but it\\'s relied upon since the class sizes are so high. So you\\'ve got parents that don\\'t know anything about education (and imagine their patience level) teaching your kids. Oh, and don\\'t be fooled by the \"high\" test scores!',\n",

The ratio is 30-32:1. There IS lots of parent involvement; however, that is only as good as the teacher is at supporting the parents. Many of the parents are under skilled and speak unkindly to the kids. The aid is really under skilled. We have heard her say things like the class is the worst she has seen and she actually tells some of the kids they are bad. Our son told us this a number of times, and we were doubtful an educated adult would use such language. Sadly, we've witnessed it first hand. In addition to the lacking social emotional support, the cirriculum is so boring. There are LOTS of worksheets, and very little interesting projects that offer creative outlets. We may have just gotten the less inspired teacher in the first grade, but we have noticed all the teachers are under tremendous stress with the numbers. It's such a shame.\",\n",

The principal has been fantastic - always available, always answering questions, knows everyone by first name. The reading and writing has been fantastic here. When we were searching for a new school (we came from Vine Hill), we wanted a christian based school with low class sizes (VH had 33:1 ratios). Baymonte and Twin Lakes (in Aptos) are the top 2 christian schools in the county, and the only schools that were on our list. We really liked both schools; I think we would of been fine at either. But ultimately, it came down to location (where we lived). We also had 2 other friends transferring with us, also no-brainer for our kids. Everyone has been so welcoming and kind. It's a very clean and tidy school. Academics and values are strong. I worry for the public school system. We wanted our children to feel confident and excel. I just didn't see that happening in the public system here in SV. At least for our kids. Baymonte has been a great decision, and I'm so happy we switched! I'm looking forward to see how the years progress.\",\n",

Our brilliant son endured a year and a half of public high school being bored out of his mind with all of the conformity and ever increasing standardized testing. This killed his passion for learning and he began believing the lies that he was not smart since he didn’t fit into this conventional model of education. His self-esteem and grades took a nose dive.Thank God we found Ms. Shauna who puts the passion back into learning. Not only a teacher, I like to think of her as a mentor/coach assisting students on their self-directed educational pathway. She really has a gift to encourage and nurture student’s gifts and passions giving them a sense of validation and boosting their self-esteem. Ms. Shauna has many unconventional tools in her teaching tool box that use creative ways to get those hated subjects completed as well as very inventive ways to get credits including (for our son):Economics and Investment Strategies (investing in crypto and stocks)Practical Math:Construction Trades (doing home remodeling)STEM:Mechanical Engineering (training/working at a motorcycle repair shop)After graduating from Pacific Sands Academy, our brilliant son loves to learn again. Most importantly, he believes in himself and has hope for his future.',\n",

My son was in 9th grade and had totally lost interest in learning and eventually pursuing a career so we decided to give this program a try and he did 10th grade with Shawna. The way she personalized and facilitated the learning experience for him was amazing! He started realizing he was now in charge of his education. He could make decisions and design his path, felt respected, understood, reassured in his individuality, assisted in finding his way and empowered to the point he felt he wanted to try going back to public school to have more of the social experience. He did that for 11th grade and when the pandemic came and all learning was online he went back to Pacific Sands and graduated at a super fast pace. He’s now in college pursuing Automotive Technology and most importantly he is excited about it. I can’t thank Shawna and her program enough for offering this wonderful alternative to traditional education.

If your child would do better at a school with lots of activities in the arts, science, math, music, etc., then I would not go to SVMS. Many public schools offer a wider variety of these activiities, esp in the silicon valley area. I do agree with the comments that this school tends to be very cliquish and there are way too many mean kids. More varied extracurricular activities would help solve this problem, allowing kids to find friends based on common interests and allowing other kids besides athletes to shine.',\n",

The principal has been fantastic - always available, always answering questions, knows everyone by first name. The reading and writing has been fantastic here. When we were searching for a new school (we came from Vine Hill), we wanted a christian based school with low class sizes (VH had 33:1 ratios). Baymonte and Twin Lakes (in Aptos) are the top 2 christian schools in the county, and the only schools that were on our list. We really liked both schools; I think we would of been fine at either. But ultimately, it came down to location (where we lived). We also had 2 other friends transferring with us, also no-brainer for our kids. Everyone has been so welcoming and kind. It's a very clean and tidy school. Academics and values are strong. I worry for the public school system. We wanted our children to feel confident and excel. I just didn't see that happening in the public system here in SV. At least for our kids. Baymonte has been a great decision, and I'm so happy we switched! I'm looking forward to see how the years progress.\",\n",

We have had children here for three years now and they are thriving. The classes are small so our children are able to get the attention they need in areas of struggle.

There are lots of opportunities for parent involvement which creates a community centered around the future of all of our children. We feel very blessed to have found this school and hope to have all of our children have the opportunity to attend K-8th here.',\n",

The program is a breath of fresh air and works very well with our busy equine sports activities and schedule.

       "       'review': 'Pacific Sands Academy is a lighthouse of hope and inspiration in a sea of educational factories. Our brilliant son endured a year and a half of public high school being bored out of his mind with all of the conformity and ever increasing standardized testing. This killed his passion for learning and he began believing the lies that he was not smart since he didn’t fit into this conventional model of education. His self-esteem and grades took a nose dive.Thank God we found Ms. Shauna who puts the passion back into learning. Not only a teacher, I like to think of her as a mentor/coach assisting students on their self-directed educational pathway. She really has a gift to encourage and nurture student’s gifts and passions giving them a sense of validation and boosting their self-esteem. Ms. Shauna has many unconventional tools in her teaching tool box that use creative ways to get those hated subjects completed as well as very inventive ways to get credits including (for our son):Economics and Investment Strategies (investing in crypto and stocks)Practical Math:Construction Trades (doing home remodeling)STEM:Mechanical Engineering (training/working at a motorcycle repair shop)After graduating from Pacific Sands Academy, our brilliant son loves to learn again. Most importantly, he believes in himself and has hope for his future.',\n",

       "       'review': 'Pacific Sands was a huge blessing in our lives. My son was in 9th grade and had totally lost interest in learning and eventually pursuing a career so we decided to give this program a try and he did 10th grade with Shawna. The way she personalized and facilitated the learning experience for him was amazing! He started realizing he was now in charge of his education. He could make decisions and design his path, felt respected, understood, reassured in his individuality, assisted in finding his way and empowered to the point he felt he wanted to try going back to public school to have more of the social experience. He did that for 11th grade and when the pandemic came and all learning was online he went back to Pacific Sands and graduated at a super fast pace. He’s now in college pursuing Automotive Technology and most importantly he is excited about it. I can’t thank Shawna and her program enough for offering this wonderful alternative to traditional education. Not every child fits that mold but they all have a huge potential and this program gives them the opportunity to discover it.',\n",

       "       'review': 'The fact that our son is actually going to graduate from high school with a diploma and possibly go on to college was no more than an impossible dream two years ago. Our 16-year old son has ADHD, and occasional moments of depression and anxiety. Until recently, this has been devastating for his education. In 2013, rather than perpetuate ongoing academic and emotional failure by sending our son to a public high school, we enrolled him in Monterey Coast Preparatory Middle and High School a small private school that focuses on helping students with severe learning disabilities. Their mission is for students to learn how they learn so that they can be academically successful. We credit the eventual realization of our dream of graduation entirely to the school, MCP Middle and High School. It s an amazing school, with a brilliant staff of teachers and administrators who have only one goal: to prove to every student that he or she CAN learn. Highly recommended !!',\n",

There are 5-6 kids in all but one of his classes which has 9, teachers who understand how to work with smart kids, laptops & software for doing work, just lots and lots of details to support his varied learning needs while providing strong academics. He gets to take classes aimed at his interests and strengths, and now loves topics like history and spanish as well as science. Our family tried an advanced private school (which really didn't accelerate learning but just piled on unneeded homework) and then home schooling to provide the enriched content our grandson deserved. Now he's doing well at school socially and academically. We're so pleased that this special place is right here in Santa Cruz. The principal and associate principal teach in addition to their other duties, and along with the other teachers, seem to know what every child is working on and doing. We have found it a very supportive place.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"I am a senior graduating with the full IB program this year. I think I had the best possible experience that this school could offer. I took the advanced math track (math academy to HL math) and I think the math teachers I had are much better than those I have heard my friends talk about in the regular math classes. My homework is obviously more intense because of my courses but I've learned to manage my time and get it all done (it is definitely doable if the student has the motivation, I still have time to swim 2-3 hours a day--although junior year every other day bc of pandemic). The teachers I had were very awesome, most of them are here because they love teaching- definitely not for the pay. We are classified as a rural school and I think that's part of why our funding is so low?? I think they are trying to apply to not be rural though-don't quote me on any of this lol. Anyways, my teachers have all been awesome and willing to help me succeed if I also want to put in the effort. By leadership I think they mean student government..they are fine lol. In my opinion they don't really lead as much as they are a clique that have fun together and sometimes put on events for the rest of us, some of them do work very had though. There is one person who is an exception- I think he is a very good leader and example to follow in everyday life who just happens to be in student gov. I am not sure how a school can develop character traits in students unless the students are also motivated. I went here and I think I have integrity, compassion and respect, but I think I would have these traits if I went somewhere else as well. I can't say much for learning differences because I dont have any, but my sister had dyslexia and the counselors helped her with her 504 plan etc pretty well I believe. However, those without diagnosed illnesses etc don't receive much help..perhaps obviously, but some of my friends are definitely struggling. Bullying at SVHS...I've heard it is not very good, especially this year in the lower grades. I know there are a couple people in my grade as well who have no? friends and people make fun of them behind backs/ talk about things they did..but also its because they do uncomfortable things. I am not sure the administration can help with situations like this? There is an anonymous tip line on the website. I do not know the procedures/consequences but I have faith that the staff genuinely wants to help us.I hope this helps.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"This school is absolutely awful. Not only is everything in the school run down and under funded, but on top of that, most of the teachers hate their jobs, are nasty to students and give lots of busy work. The worst part about the entire school is the ridiculous closed campus policy. Students are not aloud to leave the school for any reason during lunch, break, or even if they have a free period which is outrageous. The school has almost no shade too, so on hot days you are forced to sit out in the hot sun with nothing to do. On top of that they have rude and nasty staff watching, and making sure you don't go out to your car during lunch. Sitting in your car for any reason is also not aloud, which is completely outrageous. The food is also terrible and overpriced. Now, as for the students, they are pretty awful as well. Being a new student there has been one of the most terrible school experiences of my life. Not only does everyone already have friends, but no one is willing to become your friend or even talk to you due to long already made friendships since these kids have been friends from a young age. Talking to them is hard, and there are also a lot of bullies on campus that go unnoticed. Overall a terrible run down, awful school with terrible rules, regulations, and teachers, and an even more awful curriculum. I strongly recommend doing home school over this school if you can't get into another one. It has saved me so much pain, and I have been 1000x happier ever since.\",\n",

The unfortunate thing is that it is all about the IB program, which is only for Juniors and Seniors; SVHS is mostly a college prep school. I am so surprised that being near Silicon Valley with many families in the computer industry that there are no computer classes besides the graphic arts. And most electives are not advanced and there is only Spanish and French for language choices. It has been difficult for my teens find friends, since most have known each other since kindergarten and each class (Senior, Sophomore, etc) is so large that the students rarely have the same core classes.',\n",

Moving back to the Scotts Valley area was a great relief, and while we were living in Round Rock, Texas for a couple of year we found what an excellent school can offer. Returning in 2010 we've been more than pleased with what Brook Knoll offers our third son who is now in the fifth grade. All of his teachers (2nd - present) have been incredible, putting in long hours, making sure our son is challenged and that he learns to his highest potential. The teachers we've had are creative and vibrant as are all of the aids and volunteers. The parent involvement at this school is greater than any local school we've looked into, and it is not because they have to, it is because they want to. Go Eagles! BK Rocks!\",\n",

       "       'review': 'Highly disappointed with this school. We bought our first home here in SV in 2008 with the theory that our 3 kids would go all the way through the \"blue ribbon\" SV school system. After 3 years at this school, we are DONE. Pulling our two out, and heading to a local private school. The teachers here are burnt out, and just waiting on their retirement. They need some new, young, progressive thinking teachers with fresh ideas. The children are suffering from lack of new teaching styles (we\\'ve witnessed TONS of worksheets from K-2nd - the very age these kids should be learning outside or through creative ways), learning or extra support. This school used to be \\'the great little place to be\\' when I was growing up and went here. Class size is 30-34 kids. Parent involvement is good, but it\\'s relied upon since the class sizes are so high. So you\\'ve got parents that don\\'t know anything about education (and imagine their patience level) teaching your kids. Oh, and don\\'t be fooled by the \"high\" test scores!',\n",

       "       'review': \"We have been so disappointed with this school. We moved to the area with high hopes, but our experience has been very similar to the low reviews stated here. The ratio is 30-32:1. There IS lots of parent involvement; however, that is only as good as the teacher is at supporting the parents. Many of the parents are under skilled and speak unkindly to the kids. The aid is really under skilled. We have heard her say things like the class is the worst she has seen and she actually tells some of the kids they are bad. Our son told us this a number of times, and we were doubtful an educated adult would use such language. Sadly, we've witnessed it first hand. In addition to the lacking social emotional support, the cirriculum is so boring. There are LOTS of worksheets, and very little interesting projects that offer creative outlets. We may have just gotten the less inspired teacher in the first grade, but we have noticed all the teachers are under tremendous stress with the numbers. It's such a shame.\",\n",

If your child would do better at a school with lots of activities in the arts, science, math, music, etc., then I would not go to SVMS. Many public schools offer a wider variety of these activiities, esp in the silicon valley area. I do agree with the comments that this school tends to be very cliquish and there are way too many mean kids. More varied extracurricular activities would help solve this problem, allowing kids to find friends based on common interests and allowing other kids besides athletes to shine.',\n",

       "       'review': \"I am a senior graduating with the full IB program this year. I think I had the best possible experience that this school could offer. I took the advanced math track (math academy to HL math) and I think the math teachers I had are much better than those I have heard my friends talk about in the regular math classes. My homework is obviously more intense because of my courses but I've learned to manage my time and get it all done (it is definitely doable if the student has the motivation, I still have time to swim 2-3 hours a day--although junior year every other day bc of pandemic). The teachers I had were very awesome, most of them are here because they love teaching- definitely not for the pay. We are classified as a rural school and I think that's part of why our funding is so low?? I think they are trying to apply to not be rural though-don't quote me on any of this lol. Anyways, my teachers have all been awesome and willing to help me succeed if I also want to put in the effort. By leadership I think they mean student government..they are fine lol. In my opinion they don't really lead as much as they are a clique that have fun together and sometimes put on events for the rest of us, some of them do work very had though. There is one person who is an exception- I think he is a very good leader and example to follow in everyday life who just happens to be in student gov. I am not sure how a school can develop character traits in students unless the students are also motivated. I went here and I think I have integrity, compassion and respect, but I think I would have these traits if I went somewhere else as well. I can't say much for learning differences because I dont have any, but my sister had dyslexia and the counselors helped her with her 504 plan etc pretty well I believe. However, those without diagnosed illnesses etc don't receive much help..perhaps obviously, but some of my friends are definitely struggling. Bullying at SVHS...I've heard it is not very good, especially this year in the lower grades. I know there are a couple people in my grade as well who have no? friends and people make fun of them behind backs/ talk about things they did..but also its because they do uncomfortable things. I am not sure the administration can help with situations like this? There is an anonymous tip line on the website. I do not know the procedures/consequences but I have faith that the staff genuinely wants to help us.I hope this helps.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"This school is absolutely awful. Not only is everything in the school run down and under funded, but on top of that, most of the teachers hate their jobs, are nasty to students and give lots of busy work. The worst part about the entire school is the ridiculous closed campus policy. Students are not aloud to leave the school for any reason during lunch, break, or even if they have a free period which is outrageous. The school has almost no shade too, so on hot days you are forced to sit out in the hot sun with nothing to do. On top of that they have rude and nasty staff watching, and making sure you don't go out to your car during lunch. Sitting in your car for any reason is also not aloud, which is completely outrageous. The food is also terrible and overpriced. Now, as for the students, they are pretty awful as well. Being a new student there has been one of the most terrible school experiences of my life. Not only does everyone already have friends, but no one is willing to become your friend or even talk to you due to long already made friendships since these kids have been friends from a young age. Talking to them is hard, and there are also a lot of bullies on campus that go unnoticed. Overall a terrible run down, awful school with terrible rules, regulations, and teachers, and an even more awful curriculum. I strongly recommend doing home school over this school if you can't get into another one. It has saved me so much pain, and I have been 1000x happier ever since.\",\n",

The unfortunate thing is that it is all about the IB program, which is only for Juniors and Seniors; SVHS is mostly a college prep school. I am so surprised that being near Silicon Valley with many families in the computer industry that there are no computer classes besides the graphic arts. And most electives are not advanced and there is only Spanish and French for language choices. It has been difficult for my teens find friends, since most have known each other since kindergarten and each class (Senior, Sophomore, etc) is so large that the students rarely have the same core classes.',\n",

Moving back to the Scotts Valley area was a great relief, and while we were living in Round Rock, Texas for a couple of year we found what an excellent school can offer. Returning in 2010 we've been more than pleased with what Brook Knoll offers our third son who is now in the fifth grade. All of his teachers (2nd - present) have been incredible, putting in long hours, making sure our son is challenged and that he learns to his highest potential. The teachers we've had are creative and vibrant as are all of the aids and volunteers. The parent involvement at this school is greater than any local school we've looked into, and it is not because they have to, it is because they want to. Go Eagles! BK Rocks!\",\n",

The ratio is 30-32:1. There IS lots of parent involvement; however, that is only as good as the teacher is at supporting the parents. Many of the parents are under skilled and speak unkindly to the kids. The aid is really under skilled. We have heard her say things like the class is the worst she has seen and she actually tells some of the kids they are bad. Our son told us this a number of times, and we were doubtful an educated adult would use such language. Sadly, we've witnessed it first hand. In addition to the lacking social emotional support, the cirriculum is so boring. There are LOTS of worksheets, and very little interesting projects that offer creative outlets. We may have just gotten the less inspired teacher in the first grade, but we have noticed all the teachers are under tremendous stress with the numbers. It's such a shame.\",\n",

If your child would do better at a school with lots of activities in the arts, science, math, music, etc., then I would not go to SVMS. Many public schools offer a wider variety of these activiities, esp in the silicon valley area. I do agree with the comments that this school tends to be very cliquish and there are way too many mean kids. More varied extracurricular activities would help solve this problem, allowing kids to find friends based on common interests and allowing other kids besides athletes to shine.',\n",

       "       'review': \"I am a senior graduating with the full IB program this year. I think I had the best possible experience that this school could offer. I took the advanced math track (math academy to HL math) and I think the math teachers I had are much better than those I have heard my friends talk about in the regular math classes. My homework is obviously more intense because of my courses but I've learned to manage my time and get it all done (it is definitely doable if the student has the motivation, I still have time to swim 2-3 hours a day--although junior year every other day bc of pandemic). The teachers I had were very awesome, most of them are here because they love teaching- definitely not for the pay. We are classified as a rural school and I think that's part of why our funding is so low?? I think they are trying to apply to not be rural though-don't quote me on any of this lol. Anyways, my teachers have all been awesome and willing to help me succeed if I also want to put in the effort. By leadership I think they mean student government..they are fine lol. In my opinion they don't really lead as much as they are a clique that have fun together and sometimes put on events for the rest of us, some of them do work very had though. There is one person who is an exception- I think he is a very good leader and example to follow in everyday life who just happens to be in student gov. I am not sure how a school can develop character traits in students unless the students are also motivated. I went here and I think I have integrity, compassion and respect, but I think I would have these traits if I went somewhere else as well. I can't say much for learning differences because I dont have any, but my sister had dyslexia and the counselors helped her with her 504 plan etc pretty well I believe. However, those without diagnosed illnesses etc don't receive much help..perhaps obviously, but some of my friends are definitely struggling. Bullying at SVHS...I've heard it is not very good, especially this year in the lower grades. I know there are a couple people in my grade as well who have no? friends and people make fun of them behind backs/ talk about things they did..but also its because they do uncomfortable things. I am not sure the administration can help with situations like this? There is an anonymous tip line on the website. I do not know the procedures/consequences but I have faith that the staff genuinely wants to help us.I hope this helps.\",\n",

Not only is everything in the school run down and under funded, but on top of that, most of the teachers hate their jobs, are nasty to students and give lots of busy work. The worst part about the entire school is the ridiculous closed campus policy. Students are not aloud to leave the school for any reason during lunch, break, or even if they have a free period which is outrageous. The school has almost no shade too, so on hot days you are forced to sit out in the hot sun with nothing to do. On top of that they have rude and nasty staff watching, and making sure you don't go out to your car during lunch. Sitting in your car for any reason is also not aloud, which is completely outrageous. The food is also terrible and overpriced. Now, as for the students, they are pretty awful as well. Being a new student there has been one of the most terrible school experiences of my life. Not only does everyone already have friends, but no one is willing to become your friend or even talk to you due to long already made friendships since these kids have been friends from a young age. Talking to them is hard, and there are also a lot of bullies on campus that go unnoticed. Overall a terrible run down, awful school with terrible rules, regulations, and teachers, and an even more awful curriculum. I strongly recommend doing home school over this school if you can't get into another one. It has saved me so much pain, and I have been 1000x happier ever since.\",\n",
